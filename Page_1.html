           <span class="firstline">Thou shalt realise that most situations we find ourselves in are the result of our habits</span><br />
         Even though we might not always like to admit it, many of the situations we end up with in life are related to the actions that we have chosen to take.<br />
         In other words, there is no wonder you are struggling with low energy if your diet is poor, your stress levels are high, you rarely sleep and you do not move an awful lot..<br />
         Newton is third law states that:<br />
         Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.<br />
         You get out of life what you put in. Make unhealthy decisions, and it is likely that you will get unhealthy results.<br />
         Thankfully, this law is not reserved for your unhealthy habits. By adopting healthy habits and dropping ones that are holding you back, you can slowly start to transform your life situation.<br />

         <span class="firstline">Prior to changing a habit, thou shalt strive to have a clear understanding of ones current situation</span><br />
         I really like the analogy that goes something along the lines of:<br />
         A map and directions to a destination are useless, unless you know where you are in the first place.<br />
         Unless you can figure out where you are right now and how that differs from where you want to be in the future, things can be pretty tough moving forwards.<br />
         But that should not put you off or scare you into doing nothing at all. That is where it can help to consider the next point, which is..

         <span class="numbers">3</span><br />
          <span class="firstline">Thou shalt understand that many of one's habits are initially unconscious</span><br />
          Unless you are really tuned in, most of your habits are probably unconscious. They are on autopilot.<br />
          Just like you clean your teeth at a certain time each day without thinking, you may also stand in a certain way that affects your posture without realising it, or make unhealthy food choices without a second thought.<br />
          Habit changing is largely about making your habits conscious in the first place, and then altering them.<br />
          For some people this initial stage is the hardest-looking inside themselves, coming to terms with their current situation, and really figuring out what habits are serving them and what ones are not.

          <span class="numbers">4</span><br />
          <span class="firstline">Thou shalt have a clear reason 'why' to change one's habits</span><br />
          All of these fifty principles are important, but this one really stands out for me.<br />
          It is extremely difficult to create lasting changes and form sustainable healthy habits without having a clear reason 'why' for doing it.<br />
          If you are just half-heartedly trying to change a habit because a celebrity or a friend has done the same, you have a weak foundation to build upon.<br />
          It is your personal reason 'why' that will keep you going when times get a little tough. When you get tempted by that unhealthy food or you feel like skipping your scheduled workout, your big reason 'why' can keep you going.

          <span class="numbers">5</span><br />
          <span class="firstline"> One's reason 'why' should relate to one's individual values</span><br />
          Your reason 'why' will relate to your individual values - the things that are most important to you in life.<br />
          These things will differ for everyone and will evolve over time.<br />
          Some people value their family above all. To others, their career or financial status is a big priority. For me, my priorities are my loved ones and my movement practice. Any changes that I bring about in my life are for those two main causes.<br />
          Spend some time figuring out what really makes you tick, and make sure that any changes you try to make are aligned with that.

          <span class="numbers">6</span><br />
          <span class="firstline"> Thou shalt write this reason 'why' down, somewhere one will see it everyday</span><br />
          Forming Healthy Habits reason whyUsing reminders is really powerful healthy habit forming tool, and it's something we'll cover again later.<br />
          It's all well and good having your reason 'why' stored up top, but actually having it written down somewhere you'll see it everyday is infinitely more powerful.<br />
          Put it on a post it note next to your desk or on the fridge - it serves as a constant reminder to stay close to your chosen path.

          <span class="numbers">7</span><br />
          <span class="firstline"> Thou shalt only work on one or two main habits at a time</span><br />
          When you first catch the self improvement bug, it can be difficult to resist the urge to make a shed load of changes all at once.<br />
          You want all the healthy habits. You wanna be a plant-eating, hand-standing, meditating machine - right now!<br />
          Although that sounds pretty cool, the reality is that attempting to make more than one change at a time significantly decreases your chances of success. So at least in the early, fragile stages, stick with one change.<br />

          <span class="numbers">8</span><br />
         <span class="firstline"> When choosing that first habit change, thou shalt carefully consider which change will provide the most bang for it's buck.</span><br />
          As I said, the early stage of forming a new habit (or changing an old one) is fragile. It could go either way.<br />
          That's why it's important to really think about what change you're gonna attempt to make first.<br />
          Ideally it would be one that is fairly easy to make, and will also allow you to expand upon it later.<br />
          For example, changing your breakfast to something healthy is not too hard a change for most people. Having that healthy meal at the start of the day may give you more energy, which might make adding in a morning run at a later stage a much easier process.<br />
          Think long term and plan your approach before jumping in haphazardly.
