           <span class="firstline">Thou shalt realise that most situations we find ourselves in are the result of our habits.</span><br />
         Even though we might not always like to admit it, many of the situations we end up with in life are related to the actions that we have chosen to take.<br />
         In other words, there is no wonder you are struggling with low energy if your diet is poor, your stress levels are high, you rarely sleep and you do not move an awful lot..<br />

         Thankfully, this law is not reserved for your unhealthy habits. By adopting healthy habits and dropping ones that are holding you back, you can slowly start to transform your life situation.<br />

         I really like the analogy that goes something along the lines of:<br />
         A map and directions to a destination are useless, unless you know where you are in the first place.<br />
         Unless you can figure out where you are right now and how that differs from where you want to be in the future, things can be pretty tough moving forwards.<br />
         But that should not put you off or scare you into doing nothing at all. That is where it can help to consider the next point, which is..
